I got basic layout skills in Figma:

- I learned about image formats
- I learned about the basic Figma tools
- I figured out how to access the layout
- I learned about styles and distances in Figma
- I learned about exporting graphics to Figma
- I learned about fonts and their connection
- I found out what a site container is

As a result, I completed work on the first site. I made up the page according to the layout modules.html and stylized it.
