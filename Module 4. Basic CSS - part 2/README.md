I continue to learn CSS.

- Learned about positioning
- Learned about wrapping, scrolling and layer management
- Learned about working with color and text
- Learned about font properties
- Learned about background, borders and shadows
- Learned about the validity of CSS code
- Learned about the CSS code style

As a result, I applied new knowledge to style.css from past lessons
